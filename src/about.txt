PiPwn 🐧💀 – Custom Hacker Shell for Raspberry Pi
Lightweight, sexy, and deadly. A custom shell written in C, made to run on a Raspberry Pi (Zero W or any flavor), controlled from your phone (eventually 😉).

⚙️ About
PiPwn is a minimalist shell designed to:

Act as a portable hacking terminal
Support custom commands like help, version, and about
Be controlled via Termux or a future Kotlin-based mobile UI
Be modular, clean, and FAST (written in C)
Teach you system-level magic along the way
Built for the Raspberry Pi — but honestly, it'll run on anything with a terminal and a soul.

🧠 Features (v1 MVP)
 CLI interface with custom prompt (pipwn>)
 Custom command handling (help, version, etc.)
 ANSI color-coded output
 Remote communication (SSH/TCP client)
 Kotlin mobile app (later)
 Rewritten in Zig (future version)
